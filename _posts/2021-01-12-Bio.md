Mike Heroux is a Senior Research Scientist at ParaTools, Inc. and Scientist in Residence at St. Johnâ€™s University, MN. His research interests include all aspects of scalable scientific and engineering software for new and emerging parallel computing architectures.  He leads the [PESO Project](https://pesoproject.org) to steward and advance scientific software ecosystems for HPC-AI applications and computing systems.

Mike was a senior scientist at Sandia National Laboratories from May 1998 to October 2024, and was the director of software technology for the US Exascale Computing Project from 2017 - 2024. He is the founder of the Trilinos scientific libraries, Kokkos performance portability libraries and tools, the Mantevo miniapps, and HPCG Benchmark, and is presently leading the Extreme-scale Scientific Software Stack (E4S) project in DOE, a curated collection of HPC software targeting leadership platforms.

[E4S](https://e4s.io) was founded by Mike when he was the director of the ECP Software Technology focus area. E4S an ongoing effort to steward and advance the scientific software ecosystem developed during ECP. The [Trilinos Project](https://trilinos.github.io) (2004 R&D 100 winner) is an effort to provide reusable, scalable scientific software components. The [Mantevo Project](https://mantevo.github.io) (2013 R&D 100 winner) is focused on the development of open source, portable mini-applications and mini-drivers for the co-design of future supercomputers and applications. [HPCG](https://hpcg-benchmark.org) is an official TOP 500 benchmark for ranking computer systems, complementing LINPACK. [Kokkos](https://kokkos.org) is a performance portability ecosystem for expressing shared memory concurrency that emits high-performance code for GPUs and multicore and vectorizing CPUs.

Mike is involved software productivity and sustainability improvement efforts for DOE and NSF, and reproducibility initiatives for scientific publications with ACM and IEEE. He leads the IDEAS project, dedicated to engaging scientific software teams to identify and adopt practices that improve productivity and sustainability.

Mike is a Fellow of the [Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)](https://www.siam.org), a Distinguished Member of the [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)](https://www.acm.org), and a Senior Member of [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org). He has been Editor-in-Chief for the [ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software](https://dl.acm.org/journal/toms) (2011 - 2016), Subject Area Editor for the [Journal on Parallel and Distributed Computing](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-parallel-and-distributed-computing) (2012 - 2016) and Associate Editor for the [SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing](https://www.siam.org/publications/journals/siam-journal-on-scientific-computing-sisc) (2010 - 2015).  He is past chair of the SIAM Activity Group on Supercomputing and past member of the Supercomputing Conference series steering committee, focusing particularly on improving reproducibility in computational science.  

Mike is presently a member of the [ACM Publications Board](https://www.acm.org/publications/publications-board-committees). He is retired member of the [NSF Advisory Committee for Cyberinfrastructure](https://www.nsf.gov/cise/oac) and the [Advisory Board for the Molecular Sciences Software Institute](https://molssi.org).  Mike was also part of an [NISO committee on Reproducibility Badging](https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2019/01/new-niso-project-badging-scheme-reproducibility-computational-and-computing).
